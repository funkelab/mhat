    Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling is a segmentation algorithm for blob-like structures such as nuclei and
    granules with high signal intensity on low-intensity background.

    Args:
        image (np.ndarrray): _description_
        spot_sigma (float, optional): Controls how close detected cells can be by
            smoothing before detecting local maxima to use as watershed seeds.
            Defaults to 2.
        outline_sigma (float, optional): Controls how precise segmented objects are
            outlined by smoothing before performing otsu thresholding to get fg/bg mask.
            Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Labels array of same shape as input and dtype int32.
